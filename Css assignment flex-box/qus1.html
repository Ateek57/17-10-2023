    <p>Flexbox:

        One-Dimensional: Flexbox is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either as rows or columns.
        Content-Centered: It is excellent for aligning and distributing items within a container, making it suitable for centering content vertically or horizontally.
        Dynamic Sizing: Flexbox automatically resizes items to fill available space, making it great for creating flexible and dynamic layouts.
        Complex Nesting: It's ideal for handling complex nesting of elements within a single dimension, such as navigation menus, buttons, or evenly spaced items in a sidebar.

        Grid:

        Two-Dimensional: CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, where you can define both rows and columns.
        Grid Cells: It works with a grid of cells that can be explicitly placed anywhere on the grid, making it suitable for creating grid-based designs with precise control.
        Complex Layouts: Grid is great for complex layouts, like magazine-style pages or grids with items of varying sizes and alignments.
        Automatic Sizing: Grid allows for automatic sizing of columns and rows, which can simplify layout design.
